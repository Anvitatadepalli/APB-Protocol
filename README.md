# APB-Protocol
Developed by ARM, the APB protocol provides a low-power, low-complexity interface for connecting peripheral devices to a microprocessor or microcontroller. 

The AMBA APB protocol is designed to address the specific requirements of peripheral devices that operate at slower speeds and do not require high bandwidth. It is commonly used to connect peripheral devices such as timers, interrupt controllers, UARTs (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitters), and other low-speed peripherals to the system bus. 

The AMBA APB protocol serves as a crucial interface protocol for connecting peripheral devices in SoC designs. Its simplicity, low power consumption, and widespread adoption have made it a popular choice in the industry.
